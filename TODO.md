- Convert existing geometric median finding algorithms to mock private functions (only supposed to be called through geometric_median)
- Add additional geomtric median finding algorithms
- Implement sci-kit learn preprocessing normalisation methods AND denormalisation methods
- Choose the best geometric median algorithm based on input characteristics
